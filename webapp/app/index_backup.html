    <h4>What are you going to see?</h4>
    <p>
        As everyone nowadays knows, the new President of the United States Donald Trump uses Twitter as his main
        communication channel with all US citizens (and not only them). He tweets about every contemporary topic and every
        issue and he can reach an huge amount of people, thanks to his political and financial position, but also thanks
        to his speaking/writing abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are interested in studying and analyzing the format, contents and emotions contained (and sometimes hidden
        behind what he writes) in his tweets. Since these tweets reach almost everyone that has a Twitter account, it
        seemed legit to us to go deeper in the their meaning and expressions, trying to find patterns, different and common
        usages in some of the most used topics touched by Trump.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the 33k and more tweets that Trump ever made since 2009, we extracted only the ones that refer to nine different
        topics:<br>
        <!--<ul>
          <li>Internal Politics</li>
          <li>Obama</li>
          <li>Hillary Clinton</li>
          <li>Foreign Politics</li>
          <li>China</li>
          <li>Business</li>
          <li>Shows</li>
          <li>Interviews and Debates</li>
          <li>Various</li>
        </ul>-->
        Internal Politics <br> Obama <br> Hillary Clinton <br> Foreign Politics <br> China <br> Business <br> Shows <br>
        Interviews and Debates <br> Various

    </p>
    <p>
        For every topic we studied the usage during the time, the most used words, and the number of retweets and
        favorites.
        We wanted to add a sentiment analysis on every tweet that we studied and we did it. Thanks to the
        <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">datasets</a>
        offered by National Research Council Canada, we were able to build an overview of the emotions transmitted behind
        what Trump wrote.
    </p>
    <h4>How is the visualization structured?</h4>
    <p>
        After clicking the button start, two buttons will be showed: "topics" and "sentiment". Clicking on one of them
        will show bubbles referring to different topics/sentiments depending on what you previously chose. For instance,
        if you click on "topics", all the topics above listed will be displayed, one bubble for each of them. Every bubble
        has a different size, depending on how many tweets are contained in that particular topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you can see all the bubbles, you can just click on one and see all the statistics explained above. If you are
        curious to compare different topics or different sentiments, you can drop two of them in the left layer and see
        the differences between the two compared objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        OK! Now you are ready to start. Don't be shy and click the button!

    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <h5>Tweets Usage</h5>
    <p>
        We can find some interesting considerations from the tweets usage. <br>
        Since the start of his campaign, we can see a strong decrease of tweets concerning business (almost 0). Clearly,
        his first goal was politics and not business anymore. On the other hand, from 2015 Trump's interest in Foreign
        Politics increased. Following the same trend, we can observe that tweets concerning Internal Politics are mostly
        concentrated in the period of the Campaign and Presidency.<br>
        There are a lot of tweets regarding Obama in 2012 (when he was reelected), and some outliers during 2014.<br>
        We have two peaks for the shows and they both are in between two years (December 2012 and January 2013 and the
        same for 2014/2015). We can link this behavior with the confirmation from NBC of the new seasons of the show
        produced and presented by Donald Trump, Celebrity Apprentice.
    </p>
    <h5>Word Usage</h5>
    <p>
        Words usage for what concerns topics is not really interesting, we can see that the most used words are the ones
        that reflect the meaning of the topic.<br>
        TO BE CONTINUED...
    </p>
    <h5>Sentiments</h5>
    <p>
        We can see that generally Trump have more positive tweets than negative, he needs people to like him for his
        business and for his politics. More specifically we can find a confirm of this fact looking at the sentiments in
        Business, Shows and Interviews. Of course, when he speaks about his business, he has to be positive: we can see an
        high level of trust in his tweets. For what concerns shows, we can state very similar considerations: he produces
        and leads a tv show called 'Celebrity Apprentice' and he often tweets about it. He needs to transmit positive
        vibes to convince people that his show is worth watching. A very similar pattern for similar reason is found in
        the interviews and debate topic.
        For what concerns politics we have different trends: there are high level of anger and fear, with an high level of
        trust, in every topic concerning politics except for Obama, that is a little different. When it comes to politics
        he generally have slightly more negative tweets than positive. The interesting thing is that his level of trust is
        always the highest in every topic compared to the other emotions as we expected, except when he talks about
        Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.
        About the Clinton's topic, the highest emotions are anger, fear, disgust and sadness in this order. Not that it's
        not something that we were not expecting, but the fact that the trust level is lower than four other negative
        emotions it's very relevant.
        In the Obama's topic positive and negative emotions are almost at the same level, even if sadness is the highest
        emotion we can find. Levels of trust are second, so differently from Clinton topic, his more trustful when he
        speaks about Obama than Clinton.
        Note that the levels of joy are often low compared to the other emotions, except for shows and business.
    </p>
    <h5>Retweets and Favorite count</h5>
    <p>
        We can clearly see that the number of retweets and favorites are way higher when they are about Hillary Clinton.
        These tweets are from 2016 and 2017, so as we know, during the election campaign Trump's tweets reached a very
        high popularity.<br>
        Except for Hillary, the other topics have similar trends of retweets and favorite counts. Anyway, we can note that
        Internal Politics has higher values than every other topic (that is because it also contains tweets concerning
        Hillary) and also that people are generally more interested in Foreign Politics and Interviews-Debates. <br>
        Looking at the interest of the public and at the sentiment categories, the most "loved" tweets are the ones were
        Fear predominates. The three following sentiments most retweeted and liked are Anger, Disgust and Anticipation.
        It's interesting to see how tweets with a negative connotation are generally more followed by Trump's public than
        the ones with a positive connotation.
